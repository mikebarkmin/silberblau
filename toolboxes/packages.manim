manim-voiceover[gtts,recorder]==0.3.3

# install ipdb which sometimes help if bugs appear in manim-voiceover (manim-voiceover uses ipdb somewhere and if this is not installed it throws an error that the ipdb cannot be found, but if we install it, we can see a better error and better traceback what happens in manim-voiceover)
